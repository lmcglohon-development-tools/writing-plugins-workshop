A plugin can add additional fields to the advanced search interface by including a search_definitions.rb file in the plugins/local directory. 
For example, if you want to add the restrictions_apply field as the restricted boolean advanced search field for the staff interface, put this line in the plugins/local/search_definitions.rb file:
AdvancedSearch.define_field(:name => 'restricted', :type => :boolean, :visibility => [:staff], :solr_field => 'restrictions_apply').
Options are defined as:
:name â€“ used in locales file to provide value for pull-down
:type - determines what sort of search is being performed. Valid values are :text, :boolean, :date and :enum. 
:visibility - controls whether the field is presented in the staff or public interface (or both)
:solr_field - controls which field is used from the underlying index.

In order for the selection to display in the pull down for the advanced search correctly, an entry needs to be added to the plugins/local/frontend/locales/{language}.yml file. For this example:
en:  
  advanced_search:
    boolean:      
      restricted: Restricted?
