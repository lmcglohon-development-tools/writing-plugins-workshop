To override some part of a locale file for the staff interface, you can just add the following structure to the local plug-in:
plugins/local/frontend/locales/en.yml

For example, to change the text in the become-user pull-down entry, put this in the en.yml file mentioned above:
en:  
  navbar:
    become-user: Become Another User
